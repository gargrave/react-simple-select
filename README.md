# React Simple Select

This is a fairly small-ish implementation of a select-like component in React.
As the name suggests, the goal is to make a relatively simple version, so if
you're looking for something with all of the bells and whistles, you may have
better luck with [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select).

I would definitely advise against using this in any production projects. I have
pretty minimal time to work on it, and it's mostly just a fun side project for
me (i.e. I cannot guarantee any level of support).

## Getting Started

- Install:
  - `yarn add @gargrave/react-simple-select`
- Initialize the styles somewhere near the root of your project:
  - `@import '@gargrave/react-simple-select/dist/react-simple-select.css'`
  - Technically, you don't _have_ to import these styles, but this does
    apply the default styling to the component, which I think you will in
    most cases. (You can pass in custom styles to override the defaults if
    you wish.)
- Use the `Select` component in your project! A _very_ rough example might
  look something like this:

```jsx
// TODO: Sorry! A better demo will be coming soon. I ran out of time! ðŸ˜®
