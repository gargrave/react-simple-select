# React Simple Select

This is a fairly small-ish implementation of a select-like component in React. As the name suggests, the goal is to
make a relatively simple version, so if you're looking for something with all of the bells and whistles, you may have
better luck with [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select).

At this point in time, there are still some pretty essential features missing, and I haven't had time to whip up any
docs, so it's probably not a super great idea to drop this into your production project at this time.
