# React Simple Select

This is a fairly small-ish implementation of a select-like component in React.
As the name suggests, the goal is to make a relatively simple version, so if
you're looking for something with all of the bells and whistles, you may have
better luck with [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select).

At this point in time, there are still some pretty essential features missing,
and I haven't had time to whip up any docs, so it's probably not a super great
idea to drop this into your production project at this time.

## Getting Started

There are no docs yet, so this is very "use at the cost of your own sanity" for
now, but if you wish to add to your project, you can do so with
`yarn add @gargrave/react-simple-select`.
